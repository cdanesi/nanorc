# nanorc collection

Just a collection of my custom nanorc files.

**todo.nanorc** - created by me, from scratch. I fumbled my way through the RegEx on this, so I'm sure it's pretty bad. But it's been tested and is doing exactly what I wanted. Definitely need to work on the colors some. Works with [TODO.TXT](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt) format
